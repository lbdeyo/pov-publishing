      <h1>In The Afterlife, Fidel Castro Dances With Florence Henderson</h1>
      <h3>by W. Joe Hoppe</h3>
      <p>
        And the dancefloor is like an ice rink
        <br />
        they glide in and out of billowing clouds <br />
        pink mist blood of martyrs of La Revoluccion
        <br />
        soothing baby blue of suburban housewife Valium
        <br />
        <br />
        Spinning ecstatic now to their own stars
        <br />
        not proletariat red or bourgeoisie sparkly
        <br />
        no judges with magic markered cards
        <br />
        nor nosey neighbors from down the street
        <br />
        <br />
        Together again after their all-to-brief
        <br />
        NYC affair in 1958—
        <br />
        she a budding Broadway starlet
        <br />
        he a hard throwing prospect for Los Yanquis
        <br />
        <br />
        Eternity will be just like
        <br />
        their single Copacabana night
        <br />
        a spotlight on her bright blonde hair
        <br />
        the glint on his polished alligator shoes
        <br />
        <br />
        She smells like America to him
        <br />
        a hint of vanilla at neck and wrist
        <br />
        newly mown lawns and wood paneled dens
        <br />
        But when the rhumba beat starts up
        <br />
        <br />
        Her hips her culo roll with genuine desire
        <br />
        for his suave latin loins Caribbean
        <br />
        breezes blowing through pomaded hair
        <br />
        nutmeg and handrolled cigars sugarcane sweat
        <br />
        <br />
        A tango now they are joined thigh to thigh
        <br />
        zoom out to reveal the band in flamingo rhumba sleeves
        <br />
        half of them American blondes with shining teeth
        <br />
        the other swarthy Cubans knocking out time
        <br />
        <br />
        until this eternity is over
        <br />
        when they can slip out to the alley
        <br />
        and sing moonlit songs
        <br />
        of their own choosing
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>
          From 11-26-16, when Cuban Dictator Castro and Ms. Henderson, who
          starred as the mom on 70s TV series “The Brady Bunch” both died on the
          same day

      <h1>The Pantheon</h1>
      <h3>by W. Joe Hoppe</h3>
      <em>Rome, 12/26/2018</em>
      <p>
        Honoring all the gods
        <br />
        we create heaven&apos;s dome
        <br />
        so as to be human
        <br />
        beneath it
        <br />
        <br />
        Polished, chiseled,
        <br />
        sculpted stacked
        <br />
        we figure and cast
        <br />
        our knowledge
        <br />
        <br />
        out into this world
        <br />
        through numbers
        <br />
        curves degrees angles
        <br />
        it is how creation happens
        <br />
        <br />
        a perfect sphere inside
        <br />
        a perfect cube proclaims
        <br />
        understanding as
        <br />
        perfect as any
        <br />
        <br />
        now let your eye ride
        <br />
        up to the dome's pure center
        <br />
        where a perfectly placed hole
        <br />
        invites any god at all

      <h1>Going West After Uncle Art&apos;s Funeral</h1>
      <h3>by W. Joe Hoppe</h3>
      <p>
        &quot;Caravan&quot; kicks in as we clear the Houston sprawl
        <br />
        west into dark into promise towards home
        <br />
        to the Western Lands like Egypt's dead
        <br />
        ---and we're not---
        <br />
        --and Uncle Art is--
        <br />
        Night air on the highway in the
        <br />
        White headlight red taillight river
        <br />
        Onto those cinnamon hot Caravan sands
        <br />
        Uncle Art is dead and we're not
        <br />
        Opening up through the night in our grateful love bubble
        <br />
        In a focused jazz tunnel stretching
        <br />
        Through the music
        <br />
        Over the road
        <br />
        Into the night
        <br />
        Polly beside me—he was really her uncle
        <br />
        And her version of grief
        <br />
        To mine like Graham Reynolds' to Duke's
        <br />
        &quot;Caravan&quot;—
        <br />
        highway tires rolling chassis flexing engine humming
        <br />
        the car over the road
        <br />
        like the musicians through the song
        <br />
        drums bass piano horns as we all
        <br />
        dig farther into the night
        <br />
        there's a road in front of us
        <br />
        we all swear no one else has traveled
        <br />a song that no one has ever played like this.

      <h1>When All You&apos;ve Got is a Hammer</h1>

      <p>
        Lee decided to shoot
        <br />
        his brain tumor
        <br />
        w/ a .22 squirrel rifle
        <br />
        <br />
        Shaved his head
        <br />
        said he got a doctor
        <br />
        to mark the spot
        <br />
        <br />
        Wanted me to pull the trigger
        <br />
        I went down the hall
        <br />
        and kept on going
        <br />
        <br />
        Years later
        <br />
        nobody could remember
        <br />
        if it was the bullet or the cancer
