      <h3>by Don Ryan</h3>
      <p>
        Quiet sat I <br />
        On a rock on a world <br />
        And silly-scraped I <br />
        As my blonde hair curled <br />
        In the coffee pot heat <br />
        Not quite so hot <br />
        Sat I with no ears <br />
        As my eyes were not <br />
        Danced he wee wee man <br />
        In me chalkboard head <br />
        Faint painting green <br />
        All the life that lived dead <br />
        Like fat fat red red birds <br />
        And the grass soft became fingered hands about me <br />
      </p>
    </div>
