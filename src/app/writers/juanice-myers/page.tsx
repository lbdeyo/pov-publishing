      <h1>SWANS</h1>
      <h3>by Juanice Myers</h3>
      <p>
        The industrial park
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">has a beautiful pond</span>
        <br />
        And a male and female
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">swan to paddle around</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">in it.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        Each spring, they have eggs
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">and, in late May, bring forth</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">an ugly duckling who</span>
        <br />
        becomes their world as it
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">follows around behind them.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        But, after a week or so, each
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">baby dies.</span>
        <br />
        The official word is muskrats—
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">not large enough to be a threat</span>
        <br />
        to parents, but big enough to
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">get the babies.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        So, each year, the swans
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">work hard so that,</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">for one week,</span>
        <br />
        they can put all their energies
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">into a little something</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">not themselves.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        And all they know of life and
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">love is that</span>
        <br />
        A baby is something that comes
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">in the spring</span>
        <br />
        And goes away
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">very quickly.</span>

      <h1>JOHNNY C'S MOTHER</h1>
      <h3>by Juanice Myers</h3>
      <p>
        When I was in high school
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">we were always going to the drive-in</span>
        <br />
        for Cokes and hamburgers.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the carhops was a woman
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">with faded red hair and a</span>
        <br />
        Distinctive and somewhat sexy walk.
        <br />
        <br />
        One time I heard someone whisper,
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">"That's Johnny C's mother."</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        I did not know Johnny C well.
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">he wore a leather jacket</span>
        <br />
        And greased his hair into a D.A.
        <br />
        <br />
        We teenagers ate our french fries
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">and devoured our rock and roll</span>
        <br />
        And noticed that Johnny C's mother
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">had some teeth missing.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        Even though our mothers were telephone
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">operators and teachers and store clerks,</span>
        <br />
        I'm glad we never thought to make fun
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">of her.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        I wish that I had known her name and
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">that teenagers of those days</span>
        <br />
        Had known more about the wonderful
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">world of tips.</span>

      <h1>SEMINOLE</h1>
      <h3>by Juanice Myers</h3>
      <p>
        In my childhood,
        <br />
        my father had a friend
        <br />
        named Wallace.
        <br />
        <br />
        I remember he had a<br />
        silly, giggly, wonderful
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">laugh and</span>
        <br />
        he was always hitching
        <br />
        up his tool belt.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also, there was a woman
        <br />
        named "Yates" who worked
        <br />
        the lunch counter at the drug
        <br />
        store during the day and
        <br />
        sold tickets at the movie
        <br />
        theatre at night.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have no idea what
        <br />
        happened to Wallace.
        <br />
        Years later, I was told
        <br />
        that Yates was forced to
        <br />
        live with a daughter
        <br />
        who "didn't really want her."
        <br />
        <br />
        Our lives are like
        <br />
        large hoops that touch
        <br />
        in small places.
        <br />
        <br />
        We turn our heads
        <br />
        and glance at each other
        <br />
        for a few moments, then
        <br />
        remember only giggles
        <br />
        and movie tickets.
        <br />

      <h1>UNTITLED</h1>
      <h3>by Juanice Myers</h3>
      <p>
        There is a deep chasm into which,
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">if people are the right type of people,</span>
        <br />
        They can fall.
        <br />
        <br />
        They become, if they are not careful,
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">support persons…</span>
        <br />
        Male and female…
        <br />
        <br />
        Oh, don't underestimate their importance.
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">we cannot live without them and they</span>
        <br />
        do, you realize, keep the earth
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">spinning on its axis.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        You never marry them
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">or take them to bed…</span>
        <br />
        You never kiss them…
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">except on the forehead</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">or the cheek…</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        And you only find them in your thoughts
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">if you have a problem that needs</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">to be solved…</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        But support people fill a need just
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">like a good dog</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">or a keg of beer</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">or a whore</span>
        <br />
        And they are the least demanding
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">of the lot.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        You don't have to feed them
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">or buy them or</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">take them out on the town.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        And, when you are through with them,
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">they just ease very naturally and simply</span>
        <br />
        Out of your life and
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">back to where they were</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">when you found them.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        And the best part of the whole thing
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">is that</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">afterwards</span>
        <br />
        If one of them starts to
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">drink a little more than usual or</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">stay out late or</span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">
          even if this person does something really nutty
        </span>
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">with razor blades or something…</span>
        <br />
        You don't have to worry because
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">you weren't involved with him.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank God you didn't do anything
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">to cause it.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        In fact—now tell the truth—
        <br />
        <span className="ml-8">didn't you hardly know him?</span>
