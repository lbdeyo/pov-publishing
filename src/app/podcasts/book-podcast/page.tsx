              It's 1953, and the United States has just executed an American
              couple convicted of spying for the Soviet Union. Everyone is on
              edge as the Cold War standoff between communism and democracy
              leads to the rise of Senator Joe McCarthy and his zealous hunt for
              people he calls subversives or communist sympathizers. Suspicion,
              loyalty oaths, blacklists, political profiling, hostility to
              foreigners, and the assumption of guilt by association divide the
              nation. Lance and L.B. welcome L.M. Elliott to discuss the
              parallels with today's America.

            <p>
              <em>Our Band Could Be Your Life</em> is a deep investigation into
              a cultural movement that swept the U.S. in the 80s and 90s and had
              influence far beyond its most immediate listenership: Hardcore
              punk rock. It tells the story of this movement through profiles of
              its leading artists, from Black Flag and Minor Threat to the Bad
              Brains, Fugazi, Mudhoney and many others. Richard Guerrero is a
              veteran punk fan and musician who loves the book and the world
              that inspired it.
