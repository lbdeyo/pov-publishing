      <h1>Daddy Daughter Dance</h1>
      <h3>by Milaka Falk</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        In a big room filled with paintings, there stands in front of a large
        canvas
        <br />
        a little girl in sequined shoes and her daddy
        <br />
        He talks. She dances.
        <br />
        <br />
        What do you see?
        <br />
        RED!
        <br />
        Show me!
        <br />
        The little girl twirls with her hands out, her face to the ceiling
        <br />
        She twirls and spins and giggles until she falls
        <br />
        Laughing, her daddy scoops her up and sets her back down
        <br />
        What else do you see?
        <br />
        BLACK!
        <br />
        Show me!
        <br />
        The little girl plants her feet, wiggles her rear
        <br />
        She raises her hands to her face and circles her fingers
        <br />
        Laughter fills the space
        <br />
        Look closely. What is the red?
        <br />
        A house made of bricks!
        <br />
        And the black is . . .<br />
        THE BIG BAD WOLF they cry together
        <br />
        He chases her, huffing and puffing until he catches her and eats her up
        <br />
        <br />
        A pause.
        <br />
        <br />
        Daddy, do we have paints at home?
        <br />
        Yes, sweetie.
        <br />
        I wanna go home and paint!
        <br />
        Then that's what we'll do.
        <br />
        And they go home.
        <br />
        And they paint.
        <br />
        Trees and dogs and flowers
        <br />
        Houses made of sticks, of bricks and of gingerbread
        <br />
        They paint ponds and clouds and ducks
        <br />
        And when the paint is gone, the little girl dreams
        <br />
        <br />
        In a big room filled with paintings, there stands in front of a large
        canvas
        <br />
        a girl with a paper coffee cup and her dad
        <br />
        He talks. She sighs.
        <br />
        <br />
        What do you see?
        <br />
        A red blob.
        <br />
        Show me
        <br />
        The girl shifts her cup from right hand to left
        <br />
        Lifts one hand and draws a circle in the air with her finger.
        <br />
        She sighs.
        <br />
        What else do you see?
        <br />
        Black squiggles
        <br />
        Show me
        <br />
        The girl shifts her cup from left hand to right
        <br />
        Lifts one hand and flicks her fingers as if to make someone disappear
        <br />
        She sighs again
        <br />
        Look closely. What is the red?
        <br />
        A blob
        <br />
        And the black is . . .<br />
        She stares at her dad
        <br />
        Squiggles
        <br />
        He sighs
        <br />
        <br />
        A pause.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dad, do we have coffee at home?
        <br />
        Yes, sweetie.
        <br />
        I wanna go home and make a decaf
        <br />
        Then that's what we'll do.
        <br />
        And they go home.
        <br />
        And she makes a decaf.
        <br />
        And they sit in silence in separate rooms
        <br />
        And when the decaf is gone, the dad dreams
        <br />
        <br />
        In a big room filled with paintings, there stands in front of a large
        canvas
        <br />
        a young woman with new shoes and her father
        <br />
        He talks. She fidgets.
        <br />
        <br />
        What do you see?
        <br />
        Red
        <br />
        Show me
        <br />
        The young woman shakes her head and shrugs
        <br />
        She taps her toe
        <br />
        What else do you see?
        <br />
        Black
        <br />
        Show me
        <br />
        The young woman shakes her head again
        <br />
        And shrugs
        <br />
        She taps her fingers on her thigh
        <br />
        Look closely. What is the red?
        <br />
        My deadline
        <br />
        And the black is . . .<br />
        My life
        <br />
        The father chuckles
        <br />
        <br />
        A pause.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pops, do you have beer at your house?
        <br />
        Yes, sweetie.
        <br />
        I wanna come over and have a beer
        <br />
        Then that's what we'll do.
        <br />
        And they go home.
        <br />
        And they have a beer
        <br />
        And they talk of deadlines and resumes and
        <br />
        Houses with picket fences
        <br />
        And when the beer is gone, they both dream
        <br />
        <br />
        In a big room filled with paintings, there stands in front of a large
        canvas
        <br />
        a new mom with a tiny baby and a grandfather
        <br />
        He talks. She sways.
        <br />
        <br />
        What do you see?
        <br />
        A new life.
        <br />
        Show me
        <br />
        The new mom hands the grandfather the wriggling bundle.
        <br />
        He touches a tiny cheek
        <br />
        A chubby hand grabs his thumb
        <br />
        The new mom smiles.
        <br />
        What else do you see?
        <br />
        My nights!
        <br />
        Show me
        <br />
        The new mom closes her eyes slowly, then springs them open
        <br />
        Four times
        <br />
        Look closely. What is the red?
        <br />
        The future
        <br />
        And the black is . . .<br />
        My nights!
        <br />
        They smile
        <br />
        The baby stirs and starts to cry
        <br />
        <br />
        A pause.
        <br />
        <br />
        Grampa, we have to get him home
        <br />
        Yes, sweetie.
        <br />
        It's time for his nap
        <br />
        Then that's what we'll do.
        <br />
        And they go home.
        <br />
        And the baby naps.
        <br />
        And when the nap is gone, no one dreams
        <br />
        <br />
        In a big room filled with paintings, there stands in front of a large
        canvas
        <br />
        a little girl pushing a wheelchair and her daddy
        <br />
        She talks. <br />
        <br />
        What do you see?
        <br />
        Watery blue eyes lift to the top of the canvas
        <br />
        Show me!
        <br />
        Blink, blink
        <br />
        What else do you see?
        <br />
        The gaze floats to the bottom of the canvas
        <br />
        Show me!
        <br />
        Blink, blink
        <br />
        Look closely. What is the red?
        <br />
        A fragile hand with thin skin comes to rest on her cheek
        <br />
        And the black is . . .<br />
        The hand withdraws to his chest
        <br />
        <br />
        A pause.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dad?
        <br />
        A breath
        <br />
        Do you wanna go home?
        <br />
        A breath
        <br />
        Then that's what we'll do.
        <br />
        And they go home.
        <br />
        And he sleeps.
        <br />
        And he dreams
        <br />
        Of trees and dogs and flowers
        <br />
        Houses made of sticks, of bricks and of gingerbread
        <br />
        Of decaf coffees in empty rooms
        <br />
        Of deadlines and beer
        <br />
        Of tiny hands and tiny cries
        <br />
        Of daddy daughter dances
        <br />
        <br />
        And when he is gone
        <br />
        <br />
        In a big room filled with paintings, there stands in front of a large
        canvas
        <br />
        a little boy in a Batman t-shirt and his mommy
        <br />
        She talks. He dances.
