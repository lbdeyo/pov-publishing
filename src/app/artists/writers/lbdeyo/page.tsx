      <h1>The Birnbaum Case</h1>
      <h3>by L.B. Deyo</h3>
      <h2>Part I: Motive</h2>
      <p>
        I seek neither to profit from nor to extenuate of the crimes of my
        youth. I set them down as a warning to young men everywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        I must begin by explaining the unusual circumstances of my adolescence.
      </p>

      <p>
        I resided with my mother and sisters in the town of Briarcliff Manor,
        New York, but was enrolled at Horace Mann, a very expensive private
        school some thirty miles to the south.
      </p>

      <p>
        My parents had separated a year before, and my father's law firm had
        broken up under pressure from the FBI; he had not subsequently been able
        to find work and was living with his girlfriend in Manhattan. My mother,
        a decorative artist, also had no steady income. I paid my own high
        school tuition out of the savings left over from my years acting in
        television commercials.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had a great many troubles to preoccupy me in those days: the family
        strife, our sudden poverty, my abysmal academic performance, and a
        general sense that my life was a roiling, meaningless chaos. But the
        most immediate, unavoidable problem I faced on most days was getting to
        and from school.
      </p>

      <p>
        The train station was on the other side of town; about a ten-minute
        drive. Getting there was no problem in the morning; my mother would
        drive me. I'd board the train at some horrific hour, perhaps 6:50, and
        ride for a half hour. Then I'd get off and board the subway north to
        242nd Street, from whence I'd walk up the hill to school.
      </p>

      <p>
        This simple-sounding process was in fact fraught with strife and peril.
      </p>

      <h2>Part II: Hell Commute</h2>

      <p>
        What could be so rough about taking a train to the subway, and the
        subway to school?
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer, in part, is penury. Pecuniary distress. The condition or
        state of being flat broke. Which I was, most of the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        What do you do, at the age of fifteen, after boarding a commuter train,
        when you have no money for a ticket? You move around a lot. You keep an
        eye on both adjacent cars to see if a conductor's coming. If he is, you
        move to the car in the other direction. Or, if there's a conductor there
        too, you hide in the bathroom for a few stops and start over. And if you
        get caught? Well, you just don't get caught. That's all there is to
        that.
      </p>

      <p>
        At any rate, the train was the easy part. The trouble was the subway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's how it is at Marble Hill. You get off the commuter train and walk
        up several long flights of stairs to the street. Then, to get on the
        uptown one train, the subway, you cross Broadway, below the Broadway
        Bridge. Then you walk up the stairs to the elevated platform, which is
        on the bridge itself, maybe forty feet above the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now you get the shock. The uptown entrance isn't manned. It has no
        token booth, just a gate with a token machine that lets you through the
        turnstile. Not a regular turnstile, by the way. Not like the ones at
        manned entrances. This is a revolving door with metal spokes instead of
        glass windows. And here's the thing: When you put your token in the
        slot, nothing happens. The thing is busted, and nothing short of a
        dynamite charge is getting you past that turnstile.
      </p>

      <p>
        So this was interesting. I went to the downtown side, which did have a
        normal token booth, and complained. They responded with all the charm
        for which the Metropolitan Transit Authority is famous. With all the
        speed, too: The turnstile would still be broken three years later when I
        graduated.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I was on my own. I had to get on the uptown 1 train, but I couldn't
        legally access the platform. This left me a number of options, each of
        which I tried many times without ever settling on a least-awful.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, I could walk up broadway to the next station, at 235th street,
        and board there. That took about twenty minutes, which meant I got to
        Mr. Simpson's English class fifteen minutes late. Mr. Simpson was a very
        fine explainer of Shakespeare, and he could rhapsodize about the slave
        Jim from Huckleberry Finn until your heart would almost break. But he
        was not a flexible man. Show up for his class thirty seconds late, never
        mind fifteen minutes, and it was off to the Headmaster's office with you
        to fetch a "late slip," which he would then toss into his wastebasket.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second option had a similar result. I could board at Marble HIll and
        take the downtown train to Dykeman street, the nearest station that
        would allow me to transfer to the uptown side without paying again.
        Unfortunately, Dykeman street, despite it's hilarious name, was
        uninviting. It was about four stops south, which meant I'd get to school
        fifteen minutes late.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only options I had that would actually get me to school on time,
        then, required me to actually board the uptown train at Marble Hill, in
        spite of the broken turnstile. I figured out two ways to do this. The
        first was to climb around the outside of the gate that surrounded the
        platform and slip underneath. Basically I'd start at the top of the
        stairs, perhaps twenty feet up, and cling to the metal bars as I made my
        way over to a section of the fence that had a gap underneath. There,
        with great care, and still holding on tight, I'd drop down and squeeze
        through the gap. All of this done, you understand, about two stories
        over Broadway in the Bronx.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second method, which I tried only a few times, required me to pay.
        I'd board on the downtown side, and then surreptitiously descend onto
        the tracks to cross them to the uptown side.
      </p>

      <p>
        If sneaking across four lanes of subway tracks during rush hour sounds
        reckless, you don't know the half of it. It wasn't just the third rails,
        cops and speeding express trains I had to worry about. This was an
        elevated line, high above a busy avenue. These tracks were not designed
        to be walked across. They were honeycombed with huge gaps, easily big
        enough to do a cannonball through. One morning I actually made the
        crossing after a blizzard. I was actually stepping onto wooden planks
        six inches deep with snow.
      </p>

      <h2>Part III: A virtue of necessity</h2>

      <p>
        So here I was, a petty criminal, guilty of theft of services from
        Metro-North and the MTA. Not every day, you understand. Sometimes, more
        or less at random, my mother would give me money to pay my way to
        school. Or, more frequently, I'd liberate a twenty from her wallet while
        she looked the other way. But at least one day a week, I'd beat the fare
        and ride for free.
      </p>

      <p>
        At about this time, I discovered a pool hall down the hill from my
        school, in the Bronx. This was, to me, much more than a potential source
        of amusement during free periods. Shorty's pool hall was my church. For
        a punk kid who didn't fit in anywhere, it provided a template for my
        nascent personality. I got one whiff of the cigarette smoke and chalk
        dust and billiard felt and I knew what I wanted to be. I was already
        grifting, in my small way. Now I wanted to make it official. I'd become
        a pool hustler. A wise guy. A con artist.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was so perfect. I saw myself as an outsider, at once far superior and
        pathetically impotent. I was surrounded by rich kids who, it seemed to
        me, got everything handed to them on a plate while my family took
        charity from the food kitchen. But I decided, or at least hoped, that my
        little disadvantages could be spun into gold. I would have real guts, be
        a real person, learn from the streets. All that foolishness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, I dove right in. I started reading books about con artists. I
        watched movies like <i>House of Games</i> and <i>The Hustler</i> until
        my eyes crossed. I went to the pool hall every day, often several times
        a day, and was soon accepted as a regular. Real, actual pool-room bums
        called me by my first name. They'd teach me tricks and correct my
        technique. I had absolutely no native ability at pool, unfortunately.
        But I resisted that limitation with dogged, intense practice. I might
        not have had five minutes for my French homework, but I always had time
        to practice my bank shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I was lucky. That's the only way I can say it. Long before I was
        ready, I started gambling against much better players and winning. Most
        of the good players were Chinese kids from Bronx Science. These guys
        were absurdly handsome, almost beautiful. They talked with heavy accents
        but perfect grammar, and perfect slang. And they shot pool like Wild
        Bill Hickock shot a rifle. They'd saunter over to you while you
        practiced, in groups of two or three, and one of them would say the same
        thing every time: "Race to three for five?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Race to three for five. I'll tell you, those words still hit me like
        electricity. It was a bet. First guy to win three games of Nine Ball
        gets five bucks. And what was five bucks? It was a fortune. It was the
        difference between eating a real lunch and having pretzels from a
        vending machine. It was a ride home on the train without having to hide
        in the toilet from the conductors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, Nine Ball is a wonderful game for gambling, because it's got a lot
        of wild cards. First, you can win on the break, which almost never
        happens in eight ball (except on the little coin-operated barroom
        tables). Second, you can win by exploiting an unexpected opportunity
        even very early in the game. Third, you win when your opponent scratches
        three times in a row. Fourth, you can play defensively without actually
        sinking anything. In short, the game offers many opportunities to the
        inferior player. And that was me. And most of the time, if there was
        money on the table, I won. It drove people nuts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The irony of the story was that after all my research, all my practice
        and discipline, I hit upon my biggest con purely by accident.
      </p>

      <h2>Part IV: Hop in, Mr. Birnbaum</h2>

      <p>
        Fate knocked one evening as I rode home on the train towards Briarcliff
        Manor. The train was crowded, and I couldn't find a seat. I stood amidst
        a bustling crowd, more or less stuck near a couple of little bastards.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't know how else to describe them. They were about a year younger
        than me and quite a bit shorter, probably just hitting puberty. They
        were well-scrubbed and spoke in squeaky tones. Their accents, their
        hauteur, their sneakers, everything about them projected entitlement. I
        wished I had the nerve to punch them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, as it happened they got off at my stop, in Briarcliff. And they,
        like me, got into the cab. Briar Cab wasn't like the taxis in New York.
        There were no meters and they wouldn't stop to pick you up on the side
        of the road. But they'd always be there when a train pulled in from the
        city, and one cab would take everyone who needed a lift, even if it was
        six people and six different destinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now I was jammed into the back seat with these two brats. I don't
        know what I was doing in the cab. Maybe my mother had given me some
        money, or I had had a good day at the pool hall. At any rate, I was
        headed home. But the little bastards' stop was first.
      </p>

      <p>
        We pulled up at a mansion overlooking the golf course, and the first kid
        got out, but the second kid said something that rang out as a
        revelation. He said, "Charge it to Birnbaum."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Okay!" said the taxi driver, who by the way was from the old school; he
        was a carbunkled old Irish with thick glasses and a thicker New York
        accent, and he actually chewed on a half-smoked cigar. Classic.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that was it. The cabbie didn't ask the kid for I.D., or make him
        sign a paper, or anything. The kid got out, his ride fully paid for by
        those little words, "Charge it to Birnbaum."
      </p>

      <p>
        Well. Here was something to consider. And consider it I did, for days.
        It burned in my mind like the guilty recollection of a crime not yet
        committed. I never even asked myself whether it was moral. It wasn't,
        but I knew that would have no bearing on my actions. I saw myself as
        driven by an urgent need, by straitened circumstances for which I wasn't
        to blame. And also, more secretly, I saw myself as a great con artist
        waiting to be born.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a few weeks later when I next found myself in a Briar Cab, with
        the same cabbie.
      </p>

      <p>"Where to, sir?"</p>

      <p>I gave him an address about five minutes' walk from my house.</p>

      <p>
        It was a long ride. I squirmed in my seat, sweating. Could this crusty
        old hack really fall for it? Wouldn't he remember who was who? I was
        about to take a very serious risk. But ultimately, I'd already made the
        decision by getting into the cab; I didn't have a dime to my name.
      </p>

      <p>He pulled up to the address and told me the fare.</p>

      <p>I heard myself say, "Charge it to Birnbaum."</p>

      <p>"Okay!" He got on the radio. "Charge this one to Birnbaum."</p>

      <p>There was a pause at the other end, and then the voice: "Check."</p>

      <p>I got out.</p>

      <p>
        For the next several months, the Birnbaum family paid for my cab rides.
        I tried not to take cabs too often; maybe once or twice a week. It was
        still nerve racking every time. And I knew I was in deep when the cabbie
        started calling me "Mr. Birnbaum." And I'd have to answer. He even asked
        me my first name, and when I told him he said into the radio, "I've got
        Ben Birnbaum going to Todd Lane. Just charge that."
      </p>

      <p>
        Yeah. Well, that was just swell. But Ben Birnbaum of Todd Lane was about
        to hear from his benefactors.
      </p>

      <h2>Part V: The last ride</h2>

      <p>
        How long did I think I could get away with charging my cab rides to a
        family I didn't even know? I often pictured Mr. and Mrs. Birnbaum,
        standing in their kitchen reading their bill and trying to figure out
        why it was so high, or why there were so many trips to a little street
        called "Todd Lane," or what they were going to do to the son of a bitch
        who was ripping them off.
      </p>

      <p>
        One sunny evening in late spring, I stepped off of the train in
        Briarcliff and strolled down to the parking lot. The cab was there, and
        people were getting into it, but the cabbie looked distracted, and was
        talking over the radio. "Sir!" he said to me. "Get in, please. I need to
        talk to you."
      </p>

      <p>
        This was bad. First of all, he hadn't called me "Mr. Birnbaum." Second,
        cab driver's usually ask you where you're going. They don't say, "Get
        in, please." Third of all, they never need to talk to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what could I do? In I got, squeezing up against some other
        passengers.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Okay," said the cabbie, into his radio receiver. "He's here." Then he
        turned, not to me, but to the other passengers, and said, "We're going
        to make a stop before we drop you off. Sorry about that."
      </p>

      <p>
        We left the station, and turned left. This was bad. We never turned
        left, because the station was on the edge of town, and only the next
        town was to the left. The town of Ossining. Briarcliff's larger, poorer
        neighbor. Home of such attractions as Sing Sing Prison.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where the hell were we going? I couldn't ask, even if I'd wanted to. I
        was actually petrified.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was accustomed to being in trouble. I was in some kind of trouble
        every single day in those days. Every time I went to class I was in
        trouble, because I didn't have my homework. After school I was in
        trouble because I wasn't doing my homework, and because I wasn't
        studying for the test that I was about to fail. Even between classes I
        was in trouble because I was always down at the pool hall instead of on
        school grounds. I was accustomed to being in trouble. I had a defense
        against it: Spacing out. I'd just sort of mentally vanish from the room.
        And so, automatically, I abstracted myself from the back seat of that
        cab as I sat and stared through the window into the familiar strip malls
        and low-rent apartment complexes. But it was a futile exercise. I
        couldn't escape the knowledge that I was guilty, and that at the very
        least, even if the police weren't called in, the Birnbaums would expect
        to be fully repaid for each and every cab ride they'd unwittingly bought
        me.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Okay, here we are," said the cabbie, again to the other passengers. We
        pulled into a parking lot. A sign on the building read, "Briar Cab."
      </p>

      <p>
        So this was it. The little fleet known as Briar Cab had a headquarters,
        and I was here to walk the plank.
      </p>

      <p>"One second," the cabbie said, and he got out and walked inside.</p>

      <p>
        I tried to smile at the other passengers. They seemed to suspect
        something was wrong, and that it was my fault. But they couldn't have
        known for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cabbie came back. He looked at me with a pained expression, as
        though I'd just spit in his soup. "Is your name Birnbaum?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "No!" I laughed, as though it were an absurd question. As though he
        hadn't been calling me Mr. Birnbaum for the last five months. "It's
        not!"
      </p>

      <p>"Do you have permission to use the Birnbaum account?"</p>

      <p>
        "Well, not exactly officially," I said, still smiling. "I'm friends with
        their son, and he told me I could use it."
      </p>

      <p>
        The cabbie went back into the building. The other passengers had a much
        clearer grasp of the situation now. They looked at me with immense
        satisfaction. Is there any greater satisfaction in the world than seeing
        someone else caught in some little crime? If I'm doing my job, you're
        feeling a bit of that right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now the cabbie's back, and this time he gets in and starts the car. He
        turns to me and says, "The Birnbaum's say you're not allowed to use
        their account anymore."
      </p>

      <p>
        So now I'm feeling like Harrison Ford in The Fugitive, after the bus
        that's taking him to death row crashes. Yes, it's an incredible stroke
        of good fortune. No, I'm not out of danger yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not allowed to use their account anymore? That's it? No "pay us the
        money you've been stealing all year?" No "we're calling the cops on your
        narrow ass?" It was too good to be true. The whole way back to my house,
        I'm expecting a call to come in saying, "The Birnbaums want to talk to
        this kid."
      </p>

      <p>
        My course of action was clear. None of these people knew my real name,
        my phone number, nothing. If I could get out of this cab before the
        Birnbaums came to their senses, there was no way they could ever catch
        me again. There was just one problem: I had to pay for this ride. And of
        course I didn't have two nickels to rub together. My sole hope was that
        my mother, or at least her wallet, would be there when I got home.
      </p>

      <p>
        So when we pulled into my driveway, I said, "I'll be right back" and
        bolted into the house. Mom wasn't home. I didn't see any of her purses.
        I started to panic. I didn't need this cab driver ringing up the station
        and saying I was trying to beat him out of another fare. I started
        rummaging through drawers, under sofa cushions, everywhere. And then I
        saw it, in a mason jar above the stove: A crumpled old twenty-dollar
        bill. My ticket to freedom.

        I ran back out and paid the cab driver. He gave me my change. And he
        gave me something else: a break. He didn't ask me where I got off
        stealing. He didn't ask me why I'd answered to Mr. Birnbaum all year. He
        didn't even ask me what the hell I was doing living on Horsechestnut
        Road, when I'd been having him drop me off on Todd Lane. He just thanked
        me and pulled away.

        And that was the Birnbaum Case. Technically, it was the biggest con I
        ever pulled. I'd grifted close to a thousand dollars, and, a little
        embarrassment aside, gotten away with it. But there was a price to be
        paid. When I told my friends about my little cons, they looked at me
        differently. Sure, I might have been adventurous and a little crafty,
        but I was dishonest. Entertaining, colorful, but not someone to trust.
        And from then on, every time I got to the train station in Briarcliff,
        I'd stay to the shadows. I didn't want that old cabbie to see the boy he
        knew as Mr. Birnbaum.
